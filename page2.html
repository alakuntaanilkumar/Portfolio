    <p>I have trained in Python Full Stack Development, gaining practical experience in building dynamic web applications using Django, along with frontend technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and database handling. I enjoy working on real-time problem solving, clean coding practices, and learning through hands-on implementation.

I am highly motivated to begin my career in the IT industry and continuously enhance my skills through projects, online learning, and experimentation. I am adaptable, quick to learn, and committed to delivering quality work with professionalism and dedication.

My goal is to contribute to a growth-driven organization where I can strengthen my technical abilities, gain industry exposure, and be part of meaningful software development initiatives.</p>
